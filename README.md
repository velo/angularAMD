Mavenized version
==========
This fork aims to have tests using [AngularAMD](https://github.com/marcoslin/angularAMD/) being executed by [maven-karma-plugin](https://github.com/karma-runner/maven-karma-plugin)! By no means wanna be a new Angular+RequireJS bridge!

The mavenized version was created by [Marvin](https://github.com/velo/) in colaboration with [Randal](https://github.com/randalmaia/) and [Eduardo](https://github.com/eduardoazul/).

This is a work in progress and the end goal is to have a fully mavenized project.

Bower and npm are being actively removed from this fork!
